# pricingsoftwareproject
This project is to transform what I have learned in almost 100 pricing projects as a consultant into a pricing software, cheap enough for small businesses or even totally free
A little bit about my experience:  Chemical Engineer, MBA from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Quantiz Pricing Solutions founder (www.quantiz.com.br).  Have more than 25 years of work experience (20 years in pricing).
